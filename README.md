👋 Hey, I'm Vikram! I'm a software engineer. I mainly do backend, AI/ML, and algorithm development, though I've also done a bit of front-end and devops as well.
My primary language of choice is Python, though I've written some C++, JavaScript, and Java as well, and I'm actively learning Rust and Lean.

If you get to know me a bit, you'll quickly learn that I like math. A lot. I seek out math-adjacent projects to work on and will try to look for applications of math in the strangest of places.
